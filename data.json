It was during this time that the musical and cultural influences blended together to create jazz. No records were kept and recording studios and devices were not available, the history of pre-jazz is still mostly unknown. The social and cultural influences appeared to come from all directions. The African musical traditions that continued as a part of the slave culture and these traditions were superimposed on the dominant white musical culture.",

            "description": "Miles Dewey Davis III was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a roughly five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. Born into an upper-middle-class family in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, Davis started on the trumpet in his early teens. He left to study at Juilliard in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz.",
