                "description": "Drummer Baby Dodds recalled the instrumentation for the marching brass bands:\"There was a traditional line-up for the New Orleans parades. The trombones were always first. Behind the trombones would be the heavy instruments, like bass, tubas and baritones. Then behind them were the altos, two or three alto horns, and behind them were the clarinets. It was very good if there were two. Usually it was only one, an E flat. Then behind the clarinets would come the trumpets, always two or three, and they came next. Bringing up the rear would come the drums, only two, a bass drum and a snare drum. That was for balance. For funeral marches the snare drum is muffled by pulling the snares off. When the snares are off it\u2019s the same as a tom-tom. But you don\u2019t muffle drums with parades, or going back from the cemetery. At most there were eleven or twelve men in the whole brass band.\" Sometimes the same instrumentation would be employed for dances, but in many instances a smaller subset of these musicans, often joined by string players, would be used. The repertoire of these bands was remarkably varied. In addition to concert and march music, the ensembles also knew a range of quadrilles, polkas, schottisches, mazurkas, two-steps, and other popular dance styles. As the ragtime craze swept the country around the turn of the century, syncopated pieces became more and more frequently played by these bands, a shift that was accompanied by increased interest in \u201cragging\u201d more traditional compositions. This blurring of musical genres was, as we shall see, central to the creation of jazz music.",

                "description": "Buddy Bolden, often cited as the first jazz musician, may well be the most mysterious figure in the annals of New Orleans music. No recordings survive of this seminal figure\u2014despite the rumored existence of a cylinder recording from the turn of the century\u2014and no mention of his music appeared in print until 1933, two years after his death, and some three decades after Bolden contributed to the revolutionary birth of a new style of American music. Bolden would have been exposed to music not only at various social events, but also at church and in school\u2014in fact, two of John Robichaux\u2019s musicians taught at the Fisk School for Boys, which Bolden likely attended. At some point in the mid-1890s, Bolden began playing the cornet, initially taking lessons from a neighbor, and was soon supplementing his income as a plasterer with earnings from performing. At this remove, it is hard to evaluate how much formal training Bolden enjoyed. Members of the Robichaux band dismissed Bolden\u2019s group as a bunch of \u201croutineers,\u201d by which they meant fakers. Yet Bolden listed himself as a \u201cmusic teacher\u201d in the local directory. Unlike many New Orleans horn players, Bolden\u2019s initiation into the public music life of the city came not through the brass bands that figured prominently in the local social life, but instead as a member of the string ensembles that entertained at dances and parties. Bolden\u2019s single biggest contribution to jazz may have been his focus on the blues. \u201cOn those old, slow, lowdown blues, he had a moan in his cornet that went right through you,\u201d trombonist Bill Matthews recalled, \u201cjust like you were in church or something.\u201dBolden was likely incorporating the blues sensibility and structure into his music around this same time.Certainly Bolden, even if he did not invent jazz, had mastered the recipe for it, which combined the rhythms of ragtime, the bent notes and chord patterns of the blues, and an instrumentation drawn from New Orleans brass bands and string ensembles. As we have seen, the syncopated rhythms of ragtime spread into the mainstream of American culture before the the blues became well known, and Bolden can hardly take credit for this aspect of African American music, although it certainly served as another key ingredient in his work. Yet his instistence on marrying these syncopations to the blues, in an era when the latter idiom existed only on the fringes of the music world, was a brash move, and no doubt a key reason why he captured the attention of his contemporaries and the later chroniclers of New Orleans jazz.",

                "description": "Although Bolden has been typically heralded as the progenitor of jazz, such simplistic lineages ignore the broader musical ferment taking place in turn-of-the-century New Orleans. Many musicians\u2014mostly black, but also Creole and white\u2014 were experimenting with the syncopations of ragtime and the blues tonality and applying these rhythmic and melodic devices to a wide range of compositions. At first, improvisational techniques were probably used merely to ornament composed melodies, but at some point these elaborations must have evolved into more free-form solos. What began as experimentation eventually led to formalized practice. Reconstructing these events with any precision is all but impossible\u2014a terminology for describing this music would not exist for quite some time, and the first recordings of this new style would not be made for at least twenty years. Whether Bolden was the decisive figure or merely one among many to spur this transformation remains a matter for speculation. In any event, all our research indicates that sometime around the end of the nineteenth century, a growing body of musicians in New Orleans were playing a type of music that, with benefit of hindsight, can only be described as jazz. A number of uptown cornetists built on the foundations that Bolden and others had created, including Bunk Johnson, Joe \u201cKing\u201d Oliver, Mutt Carey, and later, Louis Armstrong, the greatest of the New Orleans trumpeters. But jazz quickly leaped over the racial barriers that divided New Orleans in the early 1900s. Musicians who were early practitioners of this new idiom also included Creoles Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, Kid Ory, and Freddie Keppard, as well as white players Papa Jack Laine, Emmett Hardy, Sharkey Bonano, and Nick LaRocca. By the 1920s, when the first recordings of a wide range of New Orleans jazz ensembles were made, the ethnic mix of the local bands was almost as diverse as the city\u2019s population. These recordings featured, in addition to the major black and Creole players, such ensembles as Johnny Bayersdorffer\u2019s Jazzola Novelty Orchestra, a solid New Orleans jazz band composed of musicians of central and southern European ancestry; Russ Papalia\u2019s orchestra, another jazz unit, this one primarily comprising Italian Americans; and the New Orleans Owls, which included in its ranks, among others, clarinetist Pinky Vidacovich, pianist Sigfre Christensen, trombonist Frank Netto, banjoist Rene Gelpi, and tuba player Dan LeBlanc\u2014a lineup whose lineage spanned much of Europe. Certainly jazz remained primarily an African American contribution to the city\u2019s\u2014 and, eventually, the nation\u2019s\u2014culture; but like all such contributions, once given, it no longer remained the exclusive property of the giver. Instead, destined to become part of the broader cultural gene pool, it was taken up with enthusiasm by musicians of all colors, all nationalities."

                "description": "The Eagle Band was an American jazz band during the Ragtime and Early Jazz periods, stationed in New Orleans, Louisiana. The instrumentation of the band was clarinet, drums, trombone, trumpet, guitar, and string bass, with one person on an instrument. The band was originally known as The Buddy Bolden Band, under the direction of Buddy Bolden from 1895\u20131906. On September 3, 1906, while playing in the Labor Day parade with his band, Buddy Bolden suffered a memorable breakdown, which included staggering out of marching formation and screaming. He was removed from the parade ranks and would permanently resign from the band. After the resignation of Bolden, Frankie Dusen would be the one to lead the band, and change the name from The Buddy Bolden Band, to the Eagle Band, named after the Eagle Saloon on the corner of Perdido and Rampart Streets. The band maintained the popularity it had as The Buddy Bolden Band and primarily performed the same repertoire as before. Similar to the Hard Bop combo, Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers, which would emerge in decades to come, The Eagle Band would serve as a stepping-stone for many prominent Hot Jazz players during the Early Jazz period. The Eagle Band was known as a very authentic, poignant band known for its ability to play slow gut-wrenching blues.",

                "description": "Jelly Roll Morton, the greatest of the New Orleans jazz composers, also generated controversy by his claims to have invented the music. Indeed, Morton was known to exaggerate about many things, so much so that he has acquired the persona of a blustering loudmouth in most historical accounts. However, a careful study of Morton\u2019s firsthand recollections, preserved by Alan Lomax in a series of taped interviews and performances for the Library of Congress, reveals that this often maligned figure could be, when the occasion warranted, one of the most thoughtful and accurate sources of information on early jazz. Morton\u2019s apprenticeship in the music business tookplace largely in the bordellos of Storyville (although Morton worked mainly in the white bordellos where few other jazz players could follow). Rather than regretting the low-life associations of the District, Morton luxuriated in the company of pimps, prostitutes, murderers, gamblers, pool sharks, and dealers and hustlers of various sorts, and at times could rely on a few of these trades himself. At some point in the early 1900s\u2014Morton claimed 1902, although this seems too early, given his birthdate\u2014he began working as a musician in Storyville. His great-grandmother expelled him from home when she learned of his activities in the District, and before long Morton started on the peripatetic freelancing that would occupy most of his life. His early travels brought him to Memphis, New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Tulsa, Houston, and other locales. By 1917, Morton had traveled farther west, visiting California, Canada, Alaska, and Mexico.when he returned to Chicago around 1923, Morton was well prepared to draw on his considerable talents for self-promotion in building a musical career. Certainly the time was ripe. The Jazz Age had begun in earnest, and Morton looked to capitalize on the public\u2019s insatiable demand for this new style of music.Morton\u2019s Chicago years, which lasted until 1926, constitute the most prolific musical period of his career. He made over one hundred recordings or piano rolls of his compositions, published a steady stream of pieces, and formed his most famous ensemble, the Red Hot Peppers. This band, which recorded in both Chicago and New York during the remaining years of the decade, achieved a level of collective artistry that few New Orleans groups ever matched, and none surpassed. Nor would Morton\u2019s preeminence as a jazz composer\u2014\u201cthe world\u2019s greatest hot tune writer\u201d was how his business card modestly described it\u2014be seriously challenged until Duke Ellington pushed the limits of creativity even further in the following decade. But, above all, in its mastery of ensemble interaction\u2014so essential to the New Orleans aesthetic\u2014this band remains the paragon to this day. Jelly Roll continued to record frequently during the remainder of the 1920s. The members of his band changed regularly, but, regardless of the sidemen or the evolving musical tastes of the American public, Morton\u2019s ensembles were at their best when working within the aesthetic constraints of the classic New Orleans idiom. Noteworthy Morton recordings from the 1920s include an invigorating 1927 trio session with clarinetist Johnny Dodds and drummer Baby Dodds, a tantalizing 1924 duet date with King Oliver, and Morton\u2019s 1923 work with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings.",

                "description": "One of the supreme ironies of the history of New Orleans jazz is that so much of it took place in Chicago. By the early 1920s, the center of the jazz world had clearly shifted northward. New Orleans musicians continued to dominate the idiom, but they were now operating far afield from their native soil. Well before the middle of the decade, a large cadre of major New Orleans jazz musicians were making their reputations in other locales\u2014Jelly Roll Morton left New Orleans around 1908; Freddie Keppard departed in 1914 (if not earlier); Sidney Bechet in 1916, Jimmie Noone in 1917, King Oliver in 1918, Kid Ory in 1919, Johnny Dodds around that same time, Baby Dodds in 1921, and Louis Armstrong in 1922. These moves may have begun as brief stints on the road, but in the end proved all but permanent. The vast majority of the New Orleans diaspora never returned to their home state except for brief visits.This exodus was anything but a purely musical phenomenon. Between the years 1916 and 1919, a half-million African Americans left the South for more tolerant communities in the North, with almost one million more following in their wake in the 1920s. This vast population shift, which has since come to be known as the Great Migration, encompassed the whole range of black society, from doctors and lawyers to musicians and ministers, from teachers and merchants to artisans and manual laborers. Musicians moved north for the same reasons that motivated other groups: the search for a better life, for greater opportunities to work, to support a family, to enjoy a modicum of personal freedom\u2014options that were much harder for an African American to pursue in the segregated South. As a result, in a host of major cities\u2014Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia\u2014the black population more than tripled between 1910 and 1930.",

                "description": "Johnson\u2019s own music epitomized this approach; it represents a critical link between the ragtime of Joplin and the jazz of Waller and Tatum. His early efforts remain true to the rag style, with his composition \u201cCarolina Shout\u201d gaining particular favor among his peers. The work was widely imitated by other players even before the sheet music was published, and eventually replaced the \u201cMaple Leaf Rag\u201d as the ultimate test piece for aspiring rag pianists. Johnson\u2019s works may have lacked the melodic inspiration and compositional balance that characterized Joplin\u2019s pieces, but he made up for it in the sheer breadth of his musical aspirations. His popular songs were great successes, with \u201cIf I Could Be with You (One Hour Tonight),\u201d \u201cOld Fashioned Love,\u201d and \u201cCharleston\u201d reaching a mass audience that was only vaguely familiar with the composer\u2019s jazz credentials. Yet Johnson also attacked the citadels of concert music... Even when he kept true to the stride idiom, Johnson was an inveterate experimenter who was willing to look outside the jazz and rag idiom for techniques he could apply to his compositions. These devices included classical interpolations (his repertoire included hot versions of the William Tell Overture and Peer Gynt), counterpoint exercises using national anthems (the final theme of his \u201cImitators\u2019 Rag\u201d mixes \u201cDixie\u201d in the right hand with the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d in the left), and much else besides. In later years, Johnson even adapted to the demands of jazz-combo work, recording with the Blue Note Jazzmen and on a number of sides by prominent Chicago players. There may have been greater jazz musicians than James P. Johnson, but few artists of his day sensed so clearly the latent potential of African American music or worked so vigorously to bring it into reality.",

                "description": "The Original Dixieland Jass Band (ODJB) was a Dixieland jazz band that made the first jazz recordings in early 1917. Their \"Livery Stable Blues\" became the first jazz record ever issued. The group composed and recorded many jazz standards, the most famous being \"Tiger Rag\". In late 1917, the spelling of the band's name was changed to Original Dixieland Jazz Band.ODJB billed itself as \"the Creators of Jazz\". It was the first band to record jazz commercially and to have hit recordings in the genre. Band leader and cornetist Nick LaRocca argued that ODJB deserved recognition as the first band to record jazz commercially and the first band to establish jazz as a musical idiom or genre.",

                "description": "some twenty years transpired between Bolden\u2019s glory days and the release of the first jazz recordings. Nor do these first commercial discs simplify the historian\u2019s task. If anything, the opposite is true: the history of recorded jazz was initiated with an event that remains to this day clouded in controversy. And, as with so many of the loaded issues in the story of the music, the question of race lies at the core of the dispute. In an ironic and incongruous twist of fate, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (ODJB), an ensemble consisting of white musicians, was the first to make commercial recordings of this distinctly African American music. Raised in New Orleans, these five instrumentalists\u2014leader and cornetist Nick LaRocca, clarinetist Larry Shields, trombonist Eddie Edwards, drummer Tony Sbarbaro, and pianist Henry Ragas\u2014joined forces and performed in Chicago in 1916, then opened in New York in January 1917. During an engagement at Reisenweber\u2019s Restaurant, the group attracted large audiences with its novel and spirited music, and spurred the interest of East Coast recording companies. Columbia was the first to record the band, but hesitated to release the sides because of the unconventional and ostensibly vulgar nature of the music. Soon after, the Victor label overcame such scruples, and a second session produced a major commercial success in \u201cLivery Stable Blues.\u201d",

To be sure, Louis Armstrong, who closed the book on the dynastic tradition in New Orleans jazz\u2014putting an end to its colorful lineage of Kings Bolden, Keppard, and Oliver\u2014stands out as an unlikely regicide. Armstrong always spoke with deference, bordering on awe, of his musical roots, and with especial devotion of his mentor Joe Oliver. Yet the evidence of the grooves does not lie: the superiority of Armstrong\u2019s musicianship, the unsurpassed linear momentum of his improvised lines, could serve only to make Oliver, Morton, Bolden, and the whole New Orleans ensemble tradition look pass\u00e9, a horse-and-buggy cantering by Henry Ford\u2019s assembly line. The New Orleans pioneers exit stage left; Armstrong on trumpet enters stage rightheralding the new Age of the Soloist.",

                "description": "Or so it seems in retrospect. But the ebb and flow of any history seldom match the rigid categories and sharp delineations we apply after the fact. In actuality, the revolution initiated by Armstrong took place in fits and starts, and with little fanfare at the time. After Armstrong\u2019s departure from King Oliver\u2019s Creole Jazz Band, over a year would pass before he would record as a leader. And even when those famous recordings were planned\u2014the classic \u201cHot Fives\u201d\u2014the record company considered enlisting a betterknown leader to front the band. Most accounts stress that Armstrong\u2019s talents may have been neglected by the general public, but were amply recognized by the musical community\u2014\u201chis playing was revered by countless jazz musicians,\u201d runs a typical commentary\u2014but even this claim is suspect. Fletcher Henderson, Armstrong\u2019s first major employer after Oliver, made the trumpeter accept a cut in pay to join his band. Many accounts suggest that Henderson, in fact, preferred the playing of cornetist Joe Smith, and that Armstrong was hired only because Smith was unavailable. Armstrong may not have taken New York, or even the Henderson band, by storm, but slowly and steadily he exerted his influence on the musical community. Brass players were the first to feel the heat of Armstong\u2019s rising star; but, as with Charlie Parker\u2019s innovations twenty years later, Armstrong\u2019s contributions eventually spread to every instrument in the band. Don Redman\u2019s arrangements, Coleman Hawkins\u2019s saxophone work\u2014 one by one, the converts were won.",

                "description": "Whiteman, who was originally a violinist, conducted a 40-piece U.S. Navy band in 1917\u201318 and then developed a hotel orchestra in California, which he took to New York City in 1920. He hired the best white jazz players, but he allowed little room for improvisation in his arrangements and greatly simplified jazz rhythms. He was successful as a cocomposer of popular songs during the 1920s and led his orchestra in Broadway musicals. Paul Whiteman greatly enriched American music by commissioning George Gershwin to write Rhapsody In Blue which became his orchestra\u2019s signature tune. He also \u201cdiscovered\u201d Bing Crosby and featured him in Paul Whiteman\u2019s Rhythm Boys, and gave the career of Hoagy Carmichael a boost, by recording several of Hoagy\u2019s songs early in his career. Jazz singer Mildred Bailey also rose to fame in the orchestra in the 1930s.If there is such a thing as the \u201cKing of Jazz\u201d the title belongs to Louis Armstrong, although that may not have been clear to most people in the 1920s. Whiteman is also criticized for not hiring African-American musicians to play in his band, but this argument ignores the commercial realities of the period. Paul Whiteman commissioned Duke Ellington to write for his modern music series, recorded with Paul Robeson and Billie Holiday, and hired Don Redman as an arranger in the 1930s and was generally held in high regards as a person by musicians both Black and White.",

                "description": "Fletcher Henderson, who helped define the emerging jazz big band sound in the 1920s, also drew inspiration not just from New Orleans and Chicago jazz, but even more from these currents of popular music and dance that were sweeping New York in those years. Ethel Waters, in a telling anecdote, described how she had to force Henderson to listen to player piano rolls so that he could understand how to accompany her properly on a blues recording. Henderson was a quick study and eventually made extensive use of the blues in his music, but initially it was the ethos of the ballrooms, of Tin Pan Alley, of Broadway and vaudeville, as well as of the rag bands of the Northeast that set the context for his dramatic reconstruction of the American jazz orchestra. In truth, by both temperament and training, Henderson was an unlikely jazz innovator.",

                "description": "The emergence of the big band idiom, with its subtle interweaving of four sections\u2014 saxophone, trumpet, trombone, and rhythm\u2014may seem, with the benefit of hindsight, an inevitable development in the evolution of jazz music. Was it not some law of aesthetic Darwinism that forced the rough-and-ready small combos of early jazz to give way to the more robust and polished orchestras of Ellington and Goodman? Not really. The connecting line between the roots of jazz and the later big band sound is far from direct or clear. During the so-called Jazz Age, most of the music\u2019s key exponents focused their creative energy on soloing not bandleading, on improvisation not orchestration, on an interplay between individual instruments not between sections. The move to a more compositionally oriented idiom of dance music, under the rubric of big band jazz, was anything but smooth or obvious at the time. Commercial pressures, rather than artistic prerogatives, stand out as the spur that forced many early jazz players (including Armstrong, Beiderbecke, and Hines) to embrace the big band idiom. But even in the new setting, they remained improvisers, first and foremost, not orchestrators or composers. A different body of individuals, with different talents and inclinations\u2014Don Redman, Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, Ferde Grof\u00e9, Benny Carter, Bill Challis, Art Hickman, and others\u2014 would be required to decipher the artistic implications in this shift in the public\u2019s taste, to comprehend it as a guidepost pointing to a truly revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, change in the sound of American band music.",

                "description": "Like the New Orleans tradition that preceded it, and the Swing Era offerings that followed it, Chicago jazz was not just the music of a time and place, but also a timeless style of performance\u2014and for its exponents, very much a way of life\u2014one that continues to reverberate to this day in the work of countless Dixieland and traditional jazz bands around the world. For many listeners, the Chicago style remains nothing less than the quintessential sound of jazz. Further, the association of the so-called Chicago style of music with its leading figure, Bix Beiderbecke, is also rather puzzling: Bix played little in Chicago\u2014if anything, his residencies in New York stand out as the decisive interludes in his musical career. (Then again, when dealing with the topsyturvy subject of jazz geography, be prepared for the strangest contradictions: just as much of the history of New Orleans jazz took place in Chicago, so did the sounds of Chicago jazz eventually find their most hospitable home in New York.) The further stereotype that associates early Chicago jazz almost solely with white musicians is equally off mark: as we have already seen, the finest African American musicians from New Orleans and elsewhere\u2014Armstrong, Hines, Morton, Oliver, Noone, Dodds \u2014had already gravitated to Chicago by the mid-1920s. William Howland Kenney, in his study of the biographies of fifty-five black musicians associated with Chicago jazz during the 1920s, determined that nearly half came from New Orleans, and a similar percentage arrived during or just following World War I.14 Black jazz, white jazz, hot jazz, sweet jazz, New Orleans jazz, Dixieland jazz: no matter what you call it or how you define it, it all became part of Chicago jazz during these formative years. The similarities between the music of the white Chicagoans and their New Orleans models have often been noted\u2014frequently by the Chicagoans themselves. But close listening reveals subtle gradations of difference. A certain restless energy begins to reverberate in the music. Counterpoint lines no longer weave together, as in the earlier New Orleans style, but often battle for supremacy. The specific roles filled by the New Orleans front line are modified. The tailgate trombone tradition, with its use of portamentos (or slurs) to link harmony notes, is less evident among the Chicago players; and, at times, the trombone is totally absent, replaced by the tenor sax, which takes on a more linear and overtly melodic role... Perhaps the most obvious shift came in the repertoire of the local jazz bands. During the decade of the 1920s, popular songs and thirty-two-bar forms were increasingly used by Chicago jazz musicians, while blues and multitheme ragtime structures, so central to the New Orleans tradition, became less common. This move does not seem to have been driven by aesthetic considerations\u2014it is hardly mentioned by the players themselves in the many memoirs and interviews from the period\u2014but came about gradually as a response to the changing demands of audiences. The blues recording craze of the early 1920s had already subsided by the time Chicago jazz took off in full force, while the ragtime explosion of the turn of the century was only a distant memory. In this new world of mass marketing, jazz as a category of entertainment came to occupy a wider and wider orbit, encompassing a broad spectrum of performance styles.",

Goldkette\u2019s modest ambitions\u2014primarily aimed, it seems, at producing inoffensive commercial music\u2014were what limited his achievements, not any lack of firepower on the bandstand. The Goldkette orchestra was clearly capable of playing at a much higher level than its recordings indicate. How else can we explain Rex Stewart\u2019s account of a 1926 battle of the bands between Fletcher Henderson\u2019s group (in which Stewart served as cornetist) with Goldkette\u2019s orchestra? \u201cThis proved to be a most humiliating experience for us, since, after all, we were supposed to be the world\u2019s greatest dance orchestra,\u201d Stewart later wrote. \u201cThe facts were that we simply could not compete with Jean Goldkette\u2019s Victor Recording Orchestra. Their arrangements were too imaginative, their rhythm too strong.\u201d \u201cFletcher was the King up there, had Hawk and all them guys and Goldkette\u2019s band washed them away,\u201d adds Sonny Greer. \u201cMan, that was the sensation of New York. \u2026 Goldkette\u2019s band was something else.\u201d The surviving recordings contain only hints\u2014in an occasional choice solo or well-arranged ensemble part\u2014of what Stewart describes as \u201cthe first original white swing band in history.\u201d Bix and Tram were far from the only famous jazz buddies recruited into the Goldkette band. Two innovative string soloists, guitarist Eddie Lang andviolinist Joe Venuti, were added for recording sessions, and stand out as the premier players on their instruments from the early days of jazz. Eventually the core of jazz soloists on the Goldkette roster\u2014Bix, Tram, Lang, Venuti\u2014made the move to the more successful Paul Whiteman orchestra, a group that, if anything, presents later listeners with an enigma even more puzzling than Goldkette\u2019s.",

                "description": "This difference in temperament between the two great New Orleans players is evident in their December 1924 pairing on \u201cEarly Every Morn,\u201d where they ostensibly support vocalist Alberta Hunter. Bechet\u2019s soprano work, with its mixture of high held notes and diving phrases into the lower register, blends well with the group and provides ample space for Armstrong\u2019s countermelodies. Armstrong, in contrast, assumes a more assertive posture and belts out a flamboyant coda to the performance, one that tends to eclipse Hunter and the rest of the band. Such exhibitions of technique were not Bechet\u2019s forte. Yet he too could indulge in grandstanding when the situation so warranted. On another collaboration from the period, \u201cTexas Moaner Blues,\u201d Armstrong again takes center stage with a brief burst of double time in his feature break, but Bechet is not to beoutdone in this encounter. He lets loose a swarming cannonade of angular phrases, less fluid than the cornetist\u2019s, but clearly signaling a determination to match any contender note for note, even the great Louis Armstrong. And this time Bechet steals the show with a bluesy coda.",

                "description": "A genre of blues music that became popular during the late 1920s, but already developed in African-American communities since the 1870s. This musical idiom combined insistent left-hand patterns based on blues chord progressions with syncopated melody lines or block chords in the right hand. The style demanded exceptional hand independence and a sure sense of time from the performer. The style achieved its highest pitch as unaccompanied keyboard music, although it was not uncommon for pianists to perform together in duos and trios, as on \u201cBoogie Woogie Prayer\u201d recorded by Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons, and Pete Johnson. The leading practitioners occasionally tried their dextrous hands at other keyboard styles, but, for the most part, boogie-woogie remained a fringe music, lingering in the interstices between blues and jazz."

                "description": "Historians of early twentieth-century piano styles\u2014Harlem stride, boogie-woogie, and other strands of jazz and popular keyboard music\u2014face their greatest challenge in trying to place the genrecrossing and genre-busting artist Art Tatum, whose work from the early 1930s through the mid-1950s seemed to set its own rules and follow its own evolutionary schemas. He stands out as the greatest virtuoso in the Harlem stride piano tradition\u2014and also demonstrated his mastery, on many occasions, of boogie-woogie\u2014yet he also did much more; as such, he remains a complex and controversial figure, one difficult to situate with any real precision in the stylistic pigeonholes commonly used in histories of modern American music. One invariably ends up reaching for the oldest clich\u00e9 of them all: simply asserting that Tatum was \u201cahead of his time.\u201d Yet it is equally valid to see Tatum as obsessed with the achievements of the past, not just in jazz but also in classical music, given the bravura Lisztian aspects of his playing. And though some might suggest that Art Tatum represented the finest flowering of the Harlem stride tradition, in point of fact, he rang its death knell. In developing his mature style, Tatum all but exhausted the possibilities of stride, forcing later piano modernists\u2014Monk, Powell, Tristano, Brubeck, Evans, and others\u2014to veer off into far different directions in an attempt to work their way outside the massive shadow of this imposing figure. Because of this, much of the musical vocabulary developed by Tatum remains unassimilated by later jazz pianists. Long after the phraseology of such later jazz masters as Charlie Parker and John Coltrane has been widely imitated and mastered, Tatum\u2019s legacy still sits in probate, waiting for a new generation of pianists to lay claim to its many riches.",

                "description": "This number was recorded in Chicago at the Webster Hotel on September 21st 1926 with George Mitchell cornet, Kid Ory trombone, Barney Bigard, Omer Simeon, and Darnell Howard clarinets, Ferd \"Jelly Roll\" Morton piano & speech, Johnny St Cyr guitar & speech, John Lindsay bass, Andrew Hilaire drums, and Marty Bloom sound effects.Morton\u2019s 1926 recording of his \u201cSidewalk Blues\u201d testifies to the results achieved by this single-mindedness. The piece begins with a roll call, a tenbar introduction in which each major instrument is summoned to order: piano, trombone, cornet, and clarinet. This leads directly into a twelve-bar cornet melody statement over blues harmonies supported by a stop-time vamp. Stop-time techniques such as this\u2014here the band propels the soloist with sharp accents on beats two and four\u2014were a trademark of Morton\u2019s music, invariably used for a brief spell to add variety to the accompaniment. A second twelve-bar melody follows, this time employing the interlocking trombone-cornet-clarinet counterpoint style, which is the calling card of classic New Orleans jazz. The piece then returns to the opening twelve-bar melody, but with the clarinet taking the lead this time. A four-bar interlude segues into a new thirty-two-bar melody played by cornet, trombone, and clarinet (interrupted briefly at bar sixteen by a car horn, a typical Morton novelty twist) that abandons the blues form and sensibility in favor of a plaintive parlor song style. This thirty-two-bar melody is repeated, but now played in an arrangement for three clarinets. In the context of the New Orleans style, this was a startling device. Morton brought two extra clarinetists to the session, letting them sit idly by most of the day, merely requiring their presence at certain key junctures of the performances such as this interlude. This change of instrumentation in midsong, so rare in other jazz recordings of the period, is representative of Morton\u2019s penchant to pull out some surprising sound at unexpected places in his music. This understated clarinet section changes direction dramatically in the final eight bars, with the return of the energetic New Orleans\u2013style counterpoint. A five-bar tag closes this whirlwind three-and-a-half-minute performance. In a compact form, Morton has covered a world of sounds.",

                "description": "Their 1926 duet, \u201cStringing the Blues,\u201d not only showcases their deep rapport and the ease of their playing, but is also a landmark in defining the role of guitar and violin in the jazz idiom (anticipating the celebrated later work of the Quintette of the Hot Club of France). Later collaborations, such as \u201cRunning Ragged\u201d from October 1929 and \u201cThe Wild Dog\u201d from October 1930, document the pair\u2019s progress in expanding the jazz vocabulary on their instruments. These seminal recordings went a long way toward forging a chamber music style of jazz combo playing.",

True, earlier hot musicians had often played slow blues, but the ambiance of such performances was much different from the purer, more fragile melodicism of these inspired BeiderbeckeTrumbauer collaborations. It was almost as if, before these sides, the hot and the sweet were thought to be mutually exclusive, not to be joined, except in some fanciful chimera not found in reality. But far from being opposites, these two currents, the lyric and the intense, blend seamlessly on these late vintages of the Jazz Age. Especially on \u201cI\u2019m Comin\u2019 Virginia,\u201d the 2/4 bounce so prevalent on most earlier jazz recordings gives way to a smooth 4/4 ballad tempo, helped along admirably by Eddie Lang\u2019s subtle guitar textures. Yet the achievements of the rhythm section are overshadowed by the pungent solos by Beiderbecke and Trumbauer, with their artful balance of emotion and logic. Above all, the essence of Beiderbecke\u2019s conception of jazz stands out in relief on these performances; the substitution chords implicit in his solos\u2014superimposed diminished chords, augmented chords, dominant ninth chords\u2014are incorporated with such ease that it is easy to overlook the hard harmonic edge to Bix\u2019s melodicism. Instead, the technical aspects are submerged in the free play of his musical creativity.",

The Harlem Renaissance...But another Harlem coexisted alongside this one, reflecting a crueler reality and a less promising future....Harlem was becoming a slum...Jazz was very much a part of this second Harlem\u2014more at home here than in the \u201cother\u201d Harlem of high culture and higher aspirations. True, the Harlem Renaissance created an ideology, a cultural context for jazz. But the Harlem of rent parties and underground economies created music. Even before the onset of the Great Depression, the rent party had become established as an accepted way of paying for the high cost of lodging.Flyers might be circulated up to a month in advance, advertising which entertainers would be performing. Admission on the night of the party might cost anywhere between twenty-five cents and a dollar. The money would pay for both the cost of the party and the next month\u2019s rent. \u201cThey would crowd a hundred or more people into a seven room railroad flat, and the walls would bulge,\u201d recalled Willie \u201cThe Lion\u201d Smith, one of the greatest of the Harlem pianists. \u201cSome of the parties spread to the halls and all over the building.\u201d The piano was often the battleground between these two visions of black artistic achievement. It is not going too far to suggest that the piano was to Harlem what brass bands had been to New Orleans. The instrument represented conflicting possibilities\u2014a pathway for assimilating traditional highbrow culture, a calling card of lowbrow nightlife, a symbol of middleclass prosperity, or, quite simply, a means of making a living. But, with the benefit of hindsight, we tend to view the piano in Harlem of the late 1920s and early 1930s as the center of a new type of music--harlem stride."

                "description": "Harlem stride piano, as it has come to be known, stood as a bridge between the ragtime idiom ofthe turn of the century and the new jazz piano styles that were in the process of evolution. Between 1900 and 1914, around one hundred New York companies were involved in publishing ragtime sheet music. Yet commercial interests and artistic values coexisted uneasily in Tin Pan Alley, with scores of mediocre rag songs\u2014most of them bearing little resemblance to the classic ragtime music of Scott Joplin, James Scott, and Joseph Lamb\u2014overshadowing the more sophisticated compositions of the masters. Stride piano players were well aware of the gulf between highbrow and lowbrow that Joplin\u2014perhaps foolishly, perhaps wisely\u2014had refused to recognize back in 1915; and though they sometimes tried to bridge it, they never forgot the importance of their roots in popular music. Understanding that music required an audience, preferably a large one, they mastered a wide range of novelty devices and popular effects. At times the superficial glitter could outshine the jazz content\u2014 \u201cWhen I began my work, jazz was a stunt,\u201d was Duke Ellington\u2019s later critique of some of this music11\u2014but the slick professionalism of the Harlem stride style also served to expand the audience for African American music in the face of discrimination from the cultural elite, both within and without the black community, and despite a severe economic downturn. For better or worse, the stride players did not shy away from being entertainers. Indeed, the most famous of them, Fats Waller, displayed a knack for captivating audiences unsurpassed by any jazz musician, past or present, with the possible exception of Louis Armstrong. ... ",

This overlay of artistry and combat remains an important\u2014and often overlooked\u2014 tradition in African American culture. Duke Ellington, recalling his own schooling in the Harlem stride piano tradition, explained: \u201cAnybody who had a reputation as a piano player had to prove it right there and then by sitting down to the piano and displaying his artistic wares.\u201d In later years, the cutting contest\u2014a jam session in which outplaying the other participants (\u201ccutting\u201d them, in jazz jargon)\u2014 became an important part of jazz pedagogy and practice, and the most crucial rite of passage for a young player. Its overtones now hover over even the friendliest of jazz encounters. In an age in which other art forms have come to eschew demonstrations of virtuosity, the jazz world continues to embrace one-upmanship and displays of technique as an integral part of its culture. To a great extent, the hothouse environment of Harlem helped to produce this new image of the jazz musician as half artist, half warrior.",

Record sales in the United States had surpassed one hundred million in 1927, but by 1932 only six million were sold....Thousands of them changed careers\u2014membership in the musicians\u2019 union declined by almost one-third between 1928 and 1934\u2014or else remained chronically underemployed. Greater and lesser talents suffered alike. ...their careers spiraled downward in tandem with the nation\u2019s industrial output.The end of Prohibition in 1933 transformed many speakeasies into legitimate nightclubs, but the change was hardly a positive one for most jazz players. Not only alcohol but the whole ethos and ambiance of jazz culture were demystified in the process. Both could now be easily consumed at home: alcohol legally purchased at the liquor store, jazz carried into the household over the airwaves. This was progress of sorts. Yet the harsh math of this new equation did not bode well for musicians: a single band could now entertain countless listeners through the magic of radio...Even so, the American music industry during these years was a tinderbox waiting for the spark that would set it off. The rise of network radio, much more than the earlier spread of record players, transformed the general public into passive receptors of entertainment chosen by a few arbiters of taste. The results were now all but inevitable. The mechanisms of stardom were set in place in the music world. All that was needed was the right star.",

Four months later, on December 16, 1939, he recorded the tune as \"Buddy Bolden's Blues\" on a solo session for General Records. It was later released in an album by Commodore.",

He was known during his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist. He was the last major astronomer before the invention of the telescope. Tycho Brahe has also been described as the greatest pre-telescopic astronomer. In 1572, Tycho noticed a completely new star that was brighter than any star or planet. Astonished by the existence of a star that ought not to have been there, he devoted himself to the creation of ever more accurate instruments of measurement over the next fifteen years (1576\u20131591). King Frederick II granted Tycho an estate on the island of Hven and the money to build Uraniborg, the first large observatory in Christian Europe. He later worked underground at Stjerneborg, where he realised that his instruments in Uraniborg were not sufficiently steady. His unprecedented research program both turned astronomy into the first modern science and also helped launch the Scientific Revolution.",

                "description": "Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. He believed that science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon one of the later founders of the scientific method. His portion of the method based in scepticism was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, whose practical details are still central to debates on science and methodology. He is famous for his role in the scientific revolution, promoting scientific experimentation as a way of glorifying God and fulfilling scripture."

                "description": "Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei (15 February 1564 \u2013 8 January 1642), commonly referred to as Galileo Galilei or mononymously as Galileo, was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath. He was born in the city of Pisa, then part of the Duchy of Florence. Galileo has been called the father of observational astronomy, modern-era classical physics, the scientific method, and modern science. Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of the pendulum and \"hydrostatic balances\". He was one of the earliest Renaissance developers of the thermoscope and the inventor of various military compasses. With an improved telescope he built, he observed the stars of the Milky Way, the phases of Venus, the four largest satellites of Jupiter, Saturn's rings, lunar craters and sunspots. He also built an early microscope. Galileo's championing of Copernican heliocentrism was met with opposition from within the Catholic Church and from some astronomers. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that his opinions contradicted accepted Biblical interpretations. Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack and ridicule Pope Urban VIII, thus alienating both the Pope and the Jesuits, who had both strongly supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. During this time, he wrote Two New Sciences (1638), primarily concerning kinematics and the strength of materials.",

With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the Earth\u2014it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8\u00d7 or 9\u00d7, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).",

                "description": "The Galileo affair began around 1610, and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633. Galileo was prosecuted for holding as true the doctrine of heliocentrism, the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the centre of the universe. In 1610, Galileo published his Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), describing the observations that he had made with his new, much stronger telescope, amongst them, the Galilean moons of Jupiter. With these observations and additional observations that followed, such as the phases of Venus, he promoted the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus published in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium in 1543. Galileo's opinions were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be \"formally heretical\". Galileo went on to propose a theory of tides in 1616, and of comets in 1619; he argued that the tides were evidence for the motion of the Earth. In 1632, Galileo published his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which defended heliocentrism, and was immensely popular. Responding to mounting controversy over theology, astronomy and philosophy, the Roman Inquisition tried Galileo in 1633, found him \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", and sentenced him to house arrest where he remained until his death in 1642. At that point, heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to abstain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas after the trial.",

                "description": "Sir Isaac Newton (January 25 December 1643 \u2013 31 March 20 March 1727) was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author. Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz. Newton contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science."
